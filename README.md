##Overview
Unofficial twitter API for rust.

##Examples
See examples folder.

##TODO
- parse out json returned and send structs to user - would be very cool to abstract everything away
- timeline stuff return a channel of tweets?
- potentially switch to rusts curl implementation? - much more lightweight
- continue filling out twitter REST API functionality
